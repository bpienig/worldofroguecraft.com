      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2094/blind'>Blind</a></b><i> Blinds the target, causing it to wander at 40% of move speed confused for up to 10 seconds.
        Any damage caused will remove the effect.<br></i>
      This is great for when you have 3 monsters as you can sap one blind the other and kill the 3rd. Or if you're
      low on health you can blind the target and use a bandage to heal up. In PvP it can be used as a means of
      escape by blinding your target and sprinting off into the sunset. (Or Vanishing if you don't have a DoT on
      you and the reuse timer is up.)<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2836/detect-traps'>Detect Traps</a>:</b><i> Hidden traps will become visible for 3 minutes.<br></i>
      This ability is for the most part worthless. The only place currently in game where you'll find traps
      outside of pvp is Stratholme and the traps are laughable although the word on the street is they are
      reworking traps and will be used a lot more in future instances.<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1842/disarm-trap'>Disarm Trap</a>:</b> <i>Sneak up on the trap in order to disarm it. Don't get too close or the trap will go
        off.<br></i>
      This ability is almost as useless as Detect Traps. It can be used to disarm Hunters Trap's but good luck
      trying with hunters who consider pvp standing on a trap forever firing off flares.(You can try blinding the
      hunter to get them off the trap or to give you time to disarm it.) If all you do is PVE currently you'll
      never use this ability outside of the initial quest and possible Stratholme. <br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1725/distract'>Distract</a>:</b> <i>Throws a distraction, attracting the attention of all nearby monsters for 10 seconds.
        Using this ability does not break stealth.<br></i>
      This ability has numerous uses you can use it to split up two or more monsters that are all walking in close
      proximity but are not agro linked together or even packing them in closer together if you want to. (Meaning
      they won't help each other if you attack one of them.) When stealthed in a group and you see another monster
      approaching you can use this to give your group more time to finish the monsters they're currently fighting.
      In PvP you can use this ability for when some one is running away from you by distracting them they will
      often continue running in the direction you distracted them for at least a few yards allowing you to catch
      up to them. (Or if they're not paying attention and they end up walking off a ledge into lava but really who
      would do something like that? *whistles innocently*)<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5277/evasion'>Evasion</a>:</b> <i>The rogue's dodge chance will increase by 50% for 15 seconds.
        Increases dodge chance by 50%.<br></i>
      This is great for if when you're fighting multiple opponents at once. It's also good way to keep the party
      from wiping if your tank dies and the boss your party is fighting is almost dead. It can allow you to tank
      for 15 seconds. (Or up to 30 if you have preparation and use it so you can use evasion twice.) Something
      that you will want to keep noted if you PvP is never use this ability against a warrior because they have a
      skill called Overpower which gives them a special attack every time you dodge so by using this ability you
      will only help them kill you faster. I've actually tanked all of Live Stratholme and Scholomance 5 man using
      this ability on bosses<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25302/feint'>Feint</a>:</b><i> Performs a feint, causing no damage but lowering your threat by a small amount, making the
        enemy less likely to attack you.<br></i>
      This ability is used primarily when you have some one else tanking and you want to prevent getting agro.
      This is best used after a big ambush or finishing move. It's best to use it proactively to prevent you from
      getting agro rather than using it once you already have agro. Note that this has absolutely no effect when
      you are soloing as no matter how much you lower your agro you're still going to be the only one the monster
      is ticked off with. (Yes I've heard of people who use it when soloing because and I quote 'I notice a
      difference.') The difference being the monster hates you less than before but hits you just as hard and
      often regardless.<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11286/gouge'>Gouge</a>:</b><i> Causes a small amount of damage, disorients the opponent for 4 seconds, and turns off your
        attack. Target must be facing you. Any damage caused will revive the target. Awards 1 combo points.
        <br></i>
      The primary use of this ability is in back stab builds, players gouge the target and then position
      themselves so that they are behind the npc/player and backstab. Another use is if you are trying to run away
      but you keep getting stunned you can turn around gouge the target and continue running giving yourself some
      breathing room until they stop chasing you. This ability can also be used to interrupt a caster's spell if
      your Kick ability misses. Although often times the npc will resume casting after it wears off. Keep this in
      mind when using it for this function. (Gouge is subject to diminishing returns in PVP but is on a separate
      timer from all other disorient/stun abilities.)<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17348/hemorrhage'>Hemorrhage</a>:</b><i> An instant strike that damages the opponent and causes the target to hemorrhage,
        increasing any Physical damage dealt to the target by up to 3. Lasts 30 charges or 15 seconds. Awards 1
        combo points.<br></i>
      This ability requires talent points to use and is a nice boost to group and individual DPS.
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1769/kick'>Kick</a>:</b><i> A quick kick that injures a single foe for a small amount of damage. It also interrupts
        spellcasting and prevents any spell in that school from being cast for 5 seconds.<br></i>
      The description is pretty self explanatory. Great for interrupting casters and when it misses you can follow
      up with a quick gouge to buy yourself some time. The silence effect only works if you have 2 points in
      improved kick.<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1804/pick-lock'>Pick Lock</a>:</b><i> Allows opening of locked chests and doors.<br></i>
      This is a basic rogue skill which allows rogues access to various locations in the game with out filling up
      your inventory with keys. Some locked objects require you to first press your lock picking button before you
      can unlock the object. (Example: Chest in Klaven's Tower.)<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=921/pick-pocket'>Pick Pocket</a>:</b><i> Pick the target's pocket and does not work on other players.<br></i>
      This ability is great for pick pocketing locked boxes to skill up your lock picking on and can be a source
      of some minor income. It is recommended that you do not use this when in a group or raid due to the chance
      of failure bringing you out of stealth and causing your party to wipe.<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2842/poisons'>Poisons</a>:</b><i> You can create and mix poisons, with both found and store bought ingredients.</i>
      After level 20 if you're not using poison's you're really hurting yourself. In PVP I recommend crippling
      poison combined with mind numbing poison. If you're a dagger rogue then instant poison is the way to go for
      extra damage. I'll have a more in-depth write up about the various poisons and there uses later. (Will link
      it here.)<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11297/sap'>Sap</a>:</b> <i>Disorients the target for up to 25 seconds. You must be stealthed. Only works on Humanoids
        that are not in combat. Any damage caused will revive the target. Only 1 target may be sapped at a time by
        the same rogue. However multiple rogues may each sap a different target. (Made easier/possibly with the
        talent Improved Sap)<br></i>
      This ability is great in taking any enemy out of the fight so that instead of fighting all the npc's present
      you're fighting one less. It can also be used in PVP a long with your distract ability to taunt your enemy
      although doing so can and probably will result in your death. This ability is used most when you put
      talent's into Improved Sap which gives you a 90% chance to re-stealth something that will make you welcome
      in almost any group.<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11305/sprint'>Sprint</a>:</b><i> Increases the rogue's movement speed by 70% for 15 seconds this does not break
        stealth.<br></i>
      70% Speed is with the final rank of Sprint with the lowest rank giving you a boost of 50%. This ability is
      excellent for escaping sticky situations or catching up to your fast moving prey while in stealth.<br>
      <br>
      <b><a href='https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1857/vanish'>Vanish</a>:</b><i> Allows the rogue to vanish from sight, entering an improved stealth mode for 10 seconds.
        Also breaks movement impairing effects.<br></i>
      This ability is great as an escape route for when you've bitten off more than you can chew. Or if you have
      agro on something and it just won't stop hitting you it can be used to erase all agro. In PvP it's an
      excellent way to escape after assassinating an suspecting victim. (Note any DoT's will bring you out of
      stealth rendering this ability nearly useless even if the dot only takes away mana it will act the same as
      physical damage.)<br>
