            <b><u>Deciding what race you want to be:</u></b><br>
            <br>
            There are several factors you will want to look at when you are deciding what will be the best race for you.
            The following is a list of what you should base your opinions on.<br>
            <br>
            <b>1.</b> Appearance<br>
            <b>2.</b> Faction (Horde/Alliance)<br>
            <b>3.</b> Racial Abilities<br>
            <b>4.</b> Starting Stats<br>
            <b>5.</b> Being Unique<br>
            <br>
            <u>Appearance</u>  it's all about what race you find most appealing when it comes to looking at them. For
            me this is the most important decision as no matter what race you choose there isn't such a big difference
            that you will be gimping yourself. Personally I enjoy the goofiness of being a Gnome and this was all I
            based my decision on. (Because they didn't have Halflings)<br>
            <br>
            <u>Faction</u>  Do you want to be Horde or Alliance? This decision will instantly cut the selection of what
            race you will choose by half.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Racial Abilities</u>  This is one of the most important aspects of each race you will want to base your
            decision on. Despite what you might hear no classes abilities are worthless. Some could use an improvement
            to bring them in line with other racial abilities. How ever for the races with the strong Rogue abilities
            for each faction I would recommend you look into Night Elf, and Undead. Also another consideration for PVP
            is the Gnome's size. Being small in stature it makes you harder to see in mass pvp and more able to hide
            amongst the games terrain.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Example: When comparing the Escape Artist with Will of the Forsaken, one is instant cast that breaks any
              of its listed affects and makes the user immune for 20 seconds. With Escape Artist having a 1.5 second
              cast time and able to be rooted again right away. Normally by the time Escape Artist goes off the effect
              has worn off. (Being hit extends the cast time and it can be interrupted when using it.) Still it's not a
              terrible ability just could use a slight improvement. Don't forget that just because one race might have
              much better abilities than another race does not mean Blizzard isn't going to correct the issue in the
              future as they do have a goal of having all abilities balanced and actively work towards accomplishing
              it.</i><br>
            <br>
            When deciding on racial abilities be sure to remember that some abilities are worthless to you as a Rogue
            the following is a list of those abilities that shouldn't influence your decision.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Command</b> - Pet melee damage increased by 5%<br>
            <b>Axe Specialization</b> - Orcs get +5 to Axe skill<br>
            <b>Expansive Mind</b>  Increase Intelligence by 5%<br>
            <br>
            <u>Starting Stats</u> - Once you hit level 60 starting stats really won't make you any less of a Rogue than
            any other race the difference will be very minor at best. With that in mind if you would still like to see
            what class has what stats I recommend checking out the starting stats for Rogues at wow.allakhazam.com. For
            Rogues the most important stats are Agility, Stamina, and to a lesser extent Strength.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Unique</u>  Does being unique matter to you at all? The majority of players are either Night Elves or
            Undead. If not being like the majority of other players matters to you then I would suggest one of the other
            options. <i>(GNOMES! *wink, wink*)</i><br>
            <br>
            In all seriousness all races are roughly equal while some might come out slightly ahead in some ways when
            compaired to another when compairing stats and abilities it's not enough to where I would sacrafice what I
            want to be when compaired to what I should be to be able to keep up with other races you'll do fine either
            way.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Note: it's possible that Shadow Meld gives you a +1 to your stealth level similar to the talent Master of
              Deception. How ever I saw a Blizzard Poster mention back in beta when they first came out that Shadow Meld
              did not affect stealth in any way. So while it's possible that Shadow Meld increases your stealth level I
              would take that information with a grain of salt. Unless Blizzard has come out with some information
              confirming that it does in fact affect it. If any one knows for sure please let me know. (Knows for sure
              as in they've seen it confirmed by a Blizzard Employee not through a friend of a friend)</i><br>
