    <b><u>Deciding what race you want to be:</u></b><br>
    <br>
    There are several factors you will want to look at when you are deciding what will be the best race for you.
    The following is a list of what you should base your opinions on.<br>
    <br>
    <b>1.</b> Appearance<br>
    <b>2.</b> Faction (Horde/Alliance)<br>
    <b>3.</b> Racial Abilities<br>
    <b>4.</b> Starting Stats<br>
    <b>5.</b> Being Unique<br>
    <br>
    <u>Appearance</u> - it's all about what race you find most appealing when it comes to looking at them. For
    me this is the most important decision as no matter what race you choose there isn't such a big difference
    that you will be gimping yourself. Personally I enjoy the goofiness of being a Gnome and this was all I
    based my decision on. (Because they didn't have Halflings)<br>
    <br>
    <u>Faction</u> - Do you want to be Horde or Alliance? This decision will instantly cut the selection of what
    race you will choose by half.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Racial Abilities</u> - This is one of the most important aspects of each race you will want to base your
    decision on. Despite what you might hear, no class's abilities are worthless. Some could use an improvement
    to bring them in line with other racial abilities. However, for the races with the strong Rogue abilities
    for each faction I would recommend you look into Night Elf and Undead. Also, another consideration for PVP
    is the Gnome's size. Being small in stature makes you harder to see in mass PVP and more able to hide
    amongst the game's terrain.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Example:</i> When comparing the Escape Artist with Will of the Forsaken, one is instant cast that breaks any
      of its listed effects and makes the user immune for 20 seconds. With Escape Artist having a 1.5 second
      cast time and able to be rooted again right away. Normally by the time Escape Artist goes off the effect
      has worn off. (Being hit extends the cast time and it can be interrupted when using it.) Still, it's not a
      terrible ability, just could use a slight improvement. Don't forget that just because one race might have
      much better abilities than another race does not mean Blizzard isn't going to correct the issue in the
      future as they do have a goal of having all abilities balanced and actively work towards accomplishing
      it.<br>
    <br>
    When deciding on racial abilities be sure to remember that some abilities are worthless to you as a Rogue.
    The following is a list of those abilities that shouldn't influence your decision.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Command</b> - Pet melee damage increased by 5%<br>
    <b>Axe Specialization</b> - Orcs get +5 to Axe skill<br>
    <b>Expansive Mind</b> - Increase Intelligence by 5%<br>
    <br>
    <u>Starting Stats</u> - Once you hit level 60, starting stats really won't make you any less of a Rogue than
    any other race; the difference will be very minor at best. With that in mind, if you would still like to see
    what class has what stats I recommend checking out the starting stats for Rogues at wow.allakhazam.com. For
    Rogues the most important stats are Agility, Stamina, and to a lesser extent, Strength.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Unique</u> - Does being unique matter to you at all? The majority of players are either Night Elves or
    Undead. If not being like the majority of other players matters to you, then I would suggest one of the other
    options.<br>
    <br>
    In all seriousness, all races are roughly equal. While some might come out slightly ahead in some ways when
    compared to another when comparing stats and abilities, it's not enough to where I would sacrifice what I
    want to be when compared to what I should be to be able to keep up with other races. You'll do fine either
    way.<br>
