<br>
<b>Doing the Shadowforge Key quest with three Rogues</b><i> (Needed for Barman Shanker runs)</i><br>
<br>
It's possible you could do this quest with two Rogues although it would be extremely difficult.  We did it with three rogues and experienced one death. (It was my own fault vanished to late.)<br>
<br>
<b>Things to consider:</b><br>
<br>
1. <u>Healing Potions:</u> This is one one tough guy and you'll probably need to bring some of these.<br>
<br>
2. <u>Fortitude Buff:</u> While not actually needed this would have made the fight considerably easier.<br>
<br>
3. <u>A Druid:</u> Again not actually needed but would make fightin this guy easier.<br>
<br>
<b>Getting Started:</b><br>
<br>
1. Upon first entering the instance head left through the locked gate. <i>(The lock can be picked with a skill of 280.)</i><br>
<br>
2. Go straight through this gate passed the gate on the right and the roaming fire elemental.  You will see a big tunnel with approximatly 4 guards blocking your way and a dog on each corner.  These dogs can see through stealth so stay away from them as best as you can.  Distract the group of guards so that they're all facing left.  Then very closely sneak behind them so that you don't aggro the dog who is fairly close.   Head right down the tunnel towards the big door. <i>(The one with out the massive named guy infront of it.)</i><br>
<br>
3. Go through the big door which is open just a crack but watch out for all the Dark Iron Dwarves.<br> 
<br>
4. Continue down the hall until you come to Lord Incendius.  While you're here you might as well kill him he's fairly easy and can be done with two Rogues.<br>
<br>
5. After killing Lord Incendius continue through to the next room. <i>(The Hall of Crafting.)</i><br>
<br>
6. Fineous Darkvire will be at the bottom of the stairs or if he's not he will path there and stand there for a good 10 minutes before pathing back again.  Before messing with him go to the top of the ramp and wait for the roaming Golem.   When he gets to the last ramp before reaching the top kill him and you shouldn't aggro anything else. <i>(He wiped us on our first try.)<br></i>
<br>
7. Now go to the bottom of the ramp and wait for Fineous to start walking up the ramp.  When he's about half way up get him with a cheap shot.  One thing you will want to do is try to keep this guy stunned as much as possible he hits really hard.  The fight is pretty straight forward take down his hp faster than he takes down yours.  Use your evasion all your special abilities and cool downs potions.  Save your vanish to bandage if you need to.  If you're taking aggro and need to cut back stop doing specials for a moment and just feint a few times let another rogue pick up the slack with evasion.  Neither he nor the golem run at low health so crippling poisons aren't needed here.<br>
<br>
8.  He's dead and now every ones looted the hammer.  How ever you're not done yet.  Head back the way you came to the locked gate you passed at the beginning.<br>
<br>
9. Go through this locked gate and then the locked door that is immediatly on your right.<br>
<br>
10.  Go up the staircase but be sure to avoid the fire elemental as he has a fire shield that will bring you out of stealth I usually jump onto the rail of the staircase and walk up that keeps me out of the fire shield range.<br>
<br>
11.  After reaching the top of the stairs continue going straight you'll find yourself in a massive arena stealth around the arena to the opposite side.  Go through the door and head right until it dead ends.  There is a roaming fire elemental how ever he doesn't come far enough for you to aggro him at all during the next fight.<br>
<br>
12.  Infront of you at the dead end is the statue with the missing hammer. You will need to kill the group of npcs infront of it to put your hammer in its hand.  The group should consist of something like 2 elites and 2 non elites. <i>(It changes so you might end up with 3 non elites and 2 elites or 3 elites etc..)<br></i>
<br>
13. If you have improved sap now is the time to use it.  Sap one of the elites then have another rogue sap the other elite.  Kill off the non elites and then work on the elites.  These guys will run and it can be very bad if they do so you might want to consider using crippling poison on them.  <i>(All in all we had an easier time with these guys than we did with Fineous.)</i><br>
<br>
After killing him place the hammer in the hand of the statue and you will have your new Shadowforge Key.<br>
<br>
Special thanks to two Rogues Onuobist and Talent.<br>
