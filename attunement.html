<br>
<b>Soloing the quest �Attunement to the Core�</b><i>(needed to enter Molten Core)</i><br>
<br>
Completing this quest solo isn�t extremely difficult as long as you are prepared.  There are a few things you will want to watch out for and with this guide there shouldn�t be any difficulty in getting to the Core.<br>
<br>
<b>Things to consider:</b><br>
<br>
<b>1.</b> <u>Heal Potions:</u> While these aren�t actually needed it�s good to have a few on hand for if something goes wrong. <i>(It happens)</i><br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> <u>Greater Fire Protection Potion:</u> This makes completing the quest very easy but again not required.<br>
<br>
<b>3.</b> <u>Fortitude Buff:</u> Getting fortitude from a priest before entering can help as well.<br> 
<br>
<i>(In short any thing that gives you more health helps tremendously as you will be taking a fairly long swim through lava.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Required:</b> <br>
<br>
<b>1.</b> <u>Shadowforge Key:</u> This quest can not be done with out the Shadowforge Key.  If you do not have it find a Rogue or Druid friend who does and have them lower the door. <i>(The last lock can�t be picked.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> <u>36 Silver:</u> You�ll be purchasing 6 Dark Iron Ale�s from Plugger for 6 silver each. <i>(Explained later.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Getting Started:</b><br>
<i>(First half of this guide is exactly like a Plugger run.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>1.</b> Upon first entering the instance head left through the locked gate. <i>(The lock can be picked.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> Just inside the first gate on your right is another locked gate that you�ll want to go through <i>(The lock can be picked but watch out for roaming fire guard.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>3.</b> When you go through the door there will be a 3rd locked door on your left that you will need to open.<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b> At this point look for the roaming fire guard coming down the stairs and pin him with distract by the bottom of the stairs. <br>
<br>
<b>5.</b> Stealth over to the Shadowforge Lock and click on it directly from behind to open the door upstairs. <i>(Or have your friend do it if you don�t have the Key.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>6.</b> Restealth as soon as possible because the fire guard will path towards you.<br> 
<br>
<b>7.</b> Walk up the stairs one level and turn left. There is another roaming fire guard here you have to avoid by using distract or by letting him walk by s you are pinned to the wall or if he�s coming towards me I hug the wall and allow him to pass by.<br>
<br>
<b>8.</b> Continue forward onto the covered bridge opened by the Shadowforge Lock. After the bridge is another roaming fire guard. I usually just follow behind him.<br>
<br>
<b>9.</b> You will make two lefts following the fire guard down the passage. <br>
<br>
<b>10.</b> Turn right as the passage opens into a larger room and there will be a set of stairs going down to the RIGHT <i>(left stairs go to general)</i> <br>
<br>
<b>11.</b> The next area is a bit like frogger. There are gnomes running back and forth in front of you. Avoid them and turn right at the end of the big room, before you get to the next big room. <br>
<br>
<b>12.</b> Go straight and you will see a bridge with  2 groups of 3 fire guards. Walk between them and cross the bridge this will lead you into the bar. <br>
<br>
<b>13.</b> Go upstairs and to the back of the bar you�ll see the Gnome bartender named Plugger Spazzring.  Purchase 6 Dark Iron Ale�s from Plugger.<br>
<br>
<b>14.</b> Directly across from the bar is a Dwarf named Rocknot walk over to him and he will ask for ale. <i>(He takes them in multiples of 2 so do it 3 times.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>15.</b> After giving Rocknot the 6 ale�s he�ll wander off to the giant barrels in search of more Ale.  He ends up hitting the last one which causes the cork to fly off like a rocket and break the locked door down.  At this time  the giant golem that was in the corner activates and goes to guard the door. <i>(I advise going into stealth as he heads towards the barrels.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>16.</b> Stealth passed the Golem that is guarding the broken door. Once you�re through the door head down the stairs and across the open area to the other door.<br>
<br>
<b>17.</b> Head through the door to the Chamber of Enchantment where Ambassador Flamelash is standing in the middle of the room. <i>(More precise directions to this area later)</i><br>
<br>
<b>18.</b>  Once in this room head to the far left corner once there drink the fire protection potion if you have one and wait two minutes. While you wait take a look around at the lava below you�ll see the bridge and the small rock island below. <i>(you�ll want to wait 2 minutes for the potion incase you need to you can drink another on your way there.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>19.</b> First thing you should be aware of is that there are a couple of fire guards down in the lava if you sprint, run, and jump off the platform you should land safely clear of the elementals in the lava. <i>(I recommend using your evasion right before you jump into the lava. This way if you get aggro you can swim to the island with out losing to much hp from the mobs and vanish right before you get on the island to lose aggro.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>20.</b> Swim and jump towards the island with the 4 fire elementals on it.  You can get on the island at the lowest corner closest to you with out aggroing the elementals on the island.  Go ahead and Rest up to full health before proceeding to the next step. <i>(I don�t know if jumping actually helps reduce fire damage or not but who wants to spend the time to find out for sure?)</i><br>
<br>
<b>21.</b> Stealth between the 4 elementals and you should see a ramp beneath the bridge on the left side.  While staying stealthed jump into the lava and swim to the ramp. <i>(Be sure you stay stealthed until you�re in the lava that way you don�t aggro the elementals from the island.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>22.</b> You�re nearly there walk up the ramp and turn left and sneak between the elementals to cross the bridge.  You�ll see a few more on the other side you�ll have to sneak by as well.<br>
<br>
<b>24.</b> Just outside the instance on the left wall you�ll see the pillar you need to get the shard from to complete the quest.  Grab the shard and hearth out or if your cool down isn�t done invite a friend and then disband the group to be kicked to your bind point.<br>
<br>
<b>Congratulations mission accomplished!</b><br>
<br>
<i>Side note: Damage from lava doesn�t seem to break stealth.  This might be due to the protection potion absorbing the damage.  More to come on if it brings you out of stealth when taking normal lava damage.</i><br>
