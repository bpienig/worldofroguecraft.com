<br>
I will start off by explaining what a Main Assist is.  You have your <u>Main Tanks</u>(Referred to as MT), these are normally Warriors who try to keep the aggro of the monsters focused on them.  You then have your <u>Main Assist</u>(Referred to as MA) The MA's job is to have a target for the rest of the raid to assist him on killing.<br>
In doing this the MT can continually change targets when necessary to keep building aggro on those monsters that can't be shackled, sheeped, etc... so that he is the only one taking damage.<br>
<br>
<b>First a few notes to get you started:</b>
Make a macro that when you push the button does /ra Assist me on &lt;&lt;&lt; %T &gt;&gt;&gt;  You can make the text say what ever you want as long as it has the %T on it.  This macro is very useful for when its necessary to change targets to get every one to assist you on the new target.  Or to announce in raid what you target is when you see people not assisting.(In those cases I usually push the button 3 times in a row to make sure its noticed.)<br>
<br>
In Scholo, Stratholme, and Blackrock Spires there are 3 monsters you want to always kill first.<br>
<br>
Summoners<br>
Assassins<br>
Rage Talon Fire Tongue<br>
<br>
The order which you kill these depends on what kind of crowd control you have.  If you have a lot of mages have them sheep the Assassins and Summoners and kill the Rage Talon Fire Tongue.  If you have lots of Druids sleep the dragonkin and kill Summoner then Assassins.<br>
<br>
Summoners the reason you want to kill these guys is they summon in lots of friends.  If you dont kill them as fast as possible you could find the number of monsters you're facing increasing very quickly<br>
<br>
Assassins, these guys hit like a Mac Truck.  You want to kill them as fast as possible but out of the three these are the least important but make sure your raid isn't letting one run free killing off your casters.<br>
<br>
Rage Talon Fire Tongue: These small female dragonkin cast AE's which will really tear up your raid if left uncheck one of the first targets we try to take out his this target.<br>
<br>
<b>What to do</b><br>
<br>
One duty as the MA and the part that will make you most remembered is how fast you have your next target.  You want to have the next target as fast as possible.  Either right as the monster the raid is on dies or just before.  Any pauses in targetting can and will annoy the raid.  Speed in targetting is the key.<br>
There is two ways to do this as a Rogue. You can tab or press Sinister Strike and it will target <b>the closest monster you are facing</b> I recommend constantly panning your camera angle around with your mouse while fighting looking for your next target then right before the target you're on dies click the next one you want the raid to kill.<br>
One of the most important things to remember is as the MA You're never wrong in which monster you're targetting.  This is not to say you'll never target the wrong monster it will probably happen a couple of times a raid where you will break a sheep when there is an unsheeped monster or something else will happen.  It doesn't matter if you break that sheep you stay on it and have the raid assist you on it.  If you change targets what will happen is the sheep you broke will be dotted by those who assisted you right away and it can't be crowd controlled.  Then you'll have it running loose while you're trying to have the raid kill the monster you changed your target too. So always remember if you break the crowd control stay on it and let the Mages, Priests, Druids crowd control a new target.<br>
<br>
<b>Summary:</b>
1. Target the monsters as fast as possible so there isn't a pause between each monster the raid is fighting.<br>
<br>
2. Make sure to announce to the raid if and when you need to change targets.<br>
<br>
3. If a sheep or something breaks and goes after a priest or some other caster stay on your target and have faith that the crowd control team will get it. (Unless they're incompotent which will happen from time to time.)<br>
<br>
That's the basic ground work for being an MA.  Fairly simple to learn and being a decent MA will make people remember you and invite you on future raids.  I did such a great job as MA and Top damage that on one raid they wanted to give me the Shadowcraft Tunic over another Rogue even though I lost the roll. I recommend against accepting something like that as it will only cause bad feelings between you and other Rogues which can come back to bite you in the rear on future raid invites.<br>
